summary: Universal mechanism to send messages to AI desktop apps (Claude, ChatGPT) via AppleScript. Enables notifications, scheduled prompts, CLI alerts, cross-AI comms.

interface:
  command: "send_ai_message.sh <app> <message>"
  params:
    app: {type: string, required: yes, values: [claude, chatgpt]}
    message: {type: string, required: yes, note: "can be multi-line"}
  returns: {0: success, 1: error}

behavior:
  activation: activates app, brings to foreground, 1s delay
  input: keystroke simulation via AppleScript to active conversation
  timing: {activation: 1.0s, typing: 0.5s, total_min: ~1.5s}
  targeting: sends to currently active/open conversation
  concurrency: not thread-safe, serialize with lock/queue

use_cases: [system notifications, CLI completion alerts, scheduled prompts, cross-AI comms, async collaboration]

limitations: [no response reading, no URL targeting, no retry, single-threaded, requires app focus]
