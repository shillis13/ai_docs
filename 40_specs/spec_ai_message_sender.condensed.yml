# AI Message Sender (Condensed)
# Source: spec_ai_message_sender_v1.1.yml
version: "1.0"
status: production
location: ~/bin/projects/chat_orchestrators/send_ai_message.sh

purpose: Send messages to AI apps (Claude, ChatGPT) via AppleScript automation

interface:
  command: send_ai_message.sh <app> <message>
  apps: [claude, chatgpt]
  returns: 0=success, 1=error

behavior:
  - Activates app (1s delay), types message, sends Enter (0.5s delay)
  - Targets ACTIVE conversation (no URL param - open desired chat first)
  - One-way (no response reading), not thread-safe

use_cases:
  - CLI completion notifications: "Task #1234 done. Results in responses/cli_73193/"
  - System alerts: disk warnings, errors, thresholds
  - Scheduled prompts: cron jobs for standups, checks
  - Cross-AI communication: analysis results between AIs

integration:
  cli_coordination: CLI completes → writes response → calls sender → Desktop sees notification
  file_monitoring: inotifywait + send_ai_message.sh for new files

limitations:
  - No response reading, no conversation targeting by URL
  - No retry/rate limiting/queueing, requires app focus
  - Concurrent calls may conflict

dependencies: [macOS AppleScript, System Events permissions]
