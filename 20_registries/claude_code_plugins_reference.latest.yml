summary: |
  Claude Code has a plugin ecosystem for extending functionality with commands,
  agents, skills, and MCP servers. This doc covers CLI usage, available 
  marketplaces, and installed plugins.

key_discovery: |
  CRITICAL: Two ways to manage plugins:
  1. REPL commands: /plugin (only inside running claude session)
  2. CLI subcommands: claude plugin (works from shell, scriptable)
  
  When automating via tmux/scripts, USE CLI SUBCOMMANDS. The REPL /plugin 
  commands fail with tmux send-keys due to multiline input mode stacking.

cli_commands:
  marketplace:
    list: "claude plugin marketplace list"
    add: "claude plugin marketplace add <owner/repo>"
    remove: "claude plugin marketplace remove <name>"
    update: "claude plugin marketplace update [name]"
  
  plugins:
    install: "claude plugin install <plugin>@<marketplace>"
    uninstall: "claude plugin uninstall <plugin>"
    enable: "claude plugin enable <plugin>"
    disable: "claude plugin disable <plugin>"
    update: "claude plugin update <plugin>"
    validate: "claude plugin validate <path>"

marketplaces_configured:

    homepage: https://claudecodecommands.directory
    
  superpowers-marketplace:
    repo: obra/superpowers-marketplace
    contents: obra's curated plugins - superpowers core, episodic-memory, double-shot-latte
    notable: superpowers plugin contains 20+ skills bundled together

plugins_installed:
  superpowers:
    source: superpowers-marketplace
    purpose: Core skills library
    includes:
      - test-driven-development
      - systematic-debugging
      - using-git-worktrees
      - finishing-a-development-branch
      - brainstorming (/brainstorm command)
      - write-plan (/write-plan command)
      - execute-plan (/execute-plan command)
    
  episodic-memory:
    source: superpowers-marketplace
    purpose: Semantic search across past Claude Code conversations
    use_case: "Remember what we discussed about X last week"
    
  double-shot-latte:
    source: superpowers-marketplace
    purpose: Auto-continues work instead of asking "Would you like me to continue?"
    
  ultrathink:
    source: cc-marketplace
    purpose: Multi-agent task decomposition
    agents: [Architect, Research, Coder, Tester]
    usage: "/ultrathink <task description>"
    
  update-claudemd:
    source: cc-marketplace
    purpose: Auto-updates CLAUDE.md from code changes
    
  security-guidance:
    source: claude-code-plugins
    purpose: Warns about security issues when editing files
    
  commit-commands:
    source: claude-code-plugins
    purpose: Git workflow automation

filesystem_locations:
  plugin_cache: ~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/
  marketplace_clones: ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/<marketplace>/
  config: ~/.claude.json (plugins section)

usage_patterns:
  install_from_marketplace: |
    # Add marketplace first (if not already added)
    claude plugin marketplace add owner/repo
    # Then install plugin
    claude plugin install pluginname@marketplacename
    
  browse_available: |
    # List marketplace contents
    ls ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/<name>/plugins/
    # Or check marketplace.json
    cat ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/<name>/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json

automation_notes: |
  For scripted/automated plugin management:
  - DO use: claude plugin CLI subcommands
  - DON'T use: tmux send-keys to /plugin REPL commands
  - Reason: Claude Code TUI multiline mode causes command stacking
  
  After installing plugins, restart Claude Code to activate.
