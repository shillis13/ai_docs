meta: {v: 1.1.0, schema: schema_knowledge_glossary_v1, generated: 2025-12-19, terms: 43, files: 18}

purpose: Solves bootstrap problem - Claude needs to know what's IN files to know WHEN to load them. Provides term recognition without full doc loading.

usage: |
  1. Use definition for immediate context
  2. Load primary_ref if details needed
  3. Check also_in for related context
