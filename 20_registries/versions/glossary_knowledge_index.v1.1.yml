  purpose: |
    Solves the bootstrap problem: Claude needs to know what's IN files
    to know WHEN to load them. This glossary provides term recognition
    and pointer resolution without loading full documents.

  usage: |
    When Claude encounters a term from this glossary in conversation:
    1. Use definition for immediate context
    2. Load primary_ref if details needed
    3. Check also_in for related context
