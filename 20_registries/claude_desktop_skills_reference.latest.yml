summary: |
  Claude Desktop (claude.ai and desktop app) has a Skills feature for uploading
  custom instruction packages. Different from Claude Code plugins - these are
  model-invoked instructions that activate automatically based on context.

key_concepts:
  skills_vs_plugins: |
    - Skills: Model-invoked instructions (auto-activate based on context)
    - Plugins: User-invoked commands/agents (explicit /command or @agent)
    Skills teach Claude WHEN and HOW to use tools; Plugins provide the tools.
    
  progressive_disclosure: |
    Only YAML frontmatter (name, description) scanned initially (~100 tokens).
    Full SKILL.md content loaded only when skill activates (<5K tokens).

  Packaged skills stored in ~/Downloads/claude-skills-zips/
  Source repos cloned to ~/Downloads/ for packaging
  
  NOTE: Anthropic's built-in skills (from anthropics/skills repo) cannot be
  re-uploaded - they show "skill name already in use" error because they're
  pre-installed. Only upload community skills with unique names.
