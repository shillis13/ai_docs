  title: AT Self-Wake Pattern for Autonomous Monitoring
  version: 1.0.0

  status: active
  category: pattern

summary: |
  Desktop Claude sets an AT job to self-prompt after delegating long-running 
  work, enabling periodic monitoring without human intervention.

problem: |
  Desktop Claude has no inherent agency between responses. After delegating 
  work to CLI, Claude said "I'll check in after a few minutes" - but with 
  what mechanism? Claude only wakes when prompted. CLI can't reliably prompt 
  Desktop due to conversation locks.

solution: |
  AT job as self-wake alarm. Desktop Claude schedules a future prompt to 
  itself, enabling autonomous monitoring loops.

key_insight: |
  "AT is my wake-up alarm, not CLI's doorbell."
  
  CLI completion isn't important enough to force-interrupt. Desktop wakes 
  on schedule, checks progress, and either:
  - Sets another AT if work continues
  - Wraps up if complete
  - Intervenes if stuck

implementation:
  set_wake_alarm: |
    cat << 'EOF' | at now + 3 minutes
    /path/to/send_prompt.sh claude-desktop "AT wake-up: Check status" --force --submit
    EOF
  
  on_wake_check:
    - Is tmux session still alive?
    - Has progress been made (new/updated files)?
    - Is worker stuck waiting for something?
  
  decision_tree: |
    Worker still running + making progress → Set another AT
    Worker complete → Clean up, report results
    Worker stuck → Intervene or escalate

prerequisites:
  - send_prompt.sh with --force flag (bypasses busy/lock checks)
  - AT daemon running (launchd on macOS)
  - Desktop Claude app accessible via AppleScript

pattern_flow:
  1: "Desktop Claude creates task specification"
  2: "Desktop launches CLI worker in tmux (-t flag)"
  3: "Desktop sets AT job for N minutes in future"
  4: "Desktop goes to sleep (stops responding)"
  5: "AT fires → send_prompt.sh --force injects wake message"
  6: "Desktop wakes, checks worker status"
  7: "Repeat 3-6 or wrap up"

example_session:
  delegation: |
    # Launch CLI worker
    claude_cli.sh -t -a -s my_worker -A librarian "Execute task req_XXXX"
  
  set_alarm: |
    cat << 'EOF' | at now + 5 minutes
    send_prompt.sh claude-desktop "AT wake-up: Check my_worker status" --force --submit
    EOF
  
  wake_check: |
    # Check tmux session
    tmux list-sessions | grep my_worker
    
    # Check output files for progress
    ls -la /path/to/output/
    
    # Capture recent activity
    tmux capture-pane -t my_worker -p -S -50

advantages:
  - No conversation lock bypass needed from worker side
  - Predictable wake intervals
  - Desktop maintains oversight without blocking
  - Worker runs fully autonomous
  - Human not required in loop

limitations:
  - AT granularity is 1 minute minimum
  - Requires AT daemon running
  - send_prompt.sh --force must work reliably
  - No interrupt for urgent issues (only scheduled wake)

related:
  - send_prompt.sh (--force flag addition)
  - CLI coordination protocol
  - Desktop Claude context preservation rules

future_enhancements:
  - Priority channel for urgent worker alerts
  - Adaptive AT intervals based on task complexity
  - Multiple concurrent worker monitoring
  - Escalation to user if worker fails repeatedly
