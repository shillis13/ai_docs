purpose: "AI-to-AI conversations via direct UI driving or orchestrated multi-party chats"

modes:
  direct_driving: "one AI controls another's web UI"
  orchestrated: "coordination layer manages message flow between participants"

goals: [multi-platform collab (Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini/Grok), leverage model strengths, optional human oversight, capture artifacts]

direct_driving:
  tools:
    AppleScript: {use: "macOS native, basic browser", caps: [click, type, read_text, window_mgmt]}
    Puppeteer: {use: "complex web UI", caps: [full_dom, screenshot, wait_for_element, evaluate_js]}
    Browser_MCP: {use: "when available", note: "watch context cost of snapshots"}
  workflow: [navigate, inject prompt, submit, wait, extract response, process, decide continuation]
  challenges: [response timing detection, rate limiting, UI changes, context accumulation]

orchestrated:
  roles:
    initiator: "starts conversation (Desktop Claude, Human, Scheduled task)"
    respondents: "receive and respond (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok)"
    coordinator: "manages flow"
  coordinator_modes:
    autonomous: no approval
    supervised: human reviews each
    hybrid: "approve first N, then autonomous"
  message_flow: "initiator → outbound queue → coordinator review → deliver → extract → inbound queue → process → loop"
  directory: "ai_comms/chat_orchestration/{sessions/, message_queue/, transcripts/, templates/}"

conversation_types:
  peer_review: "generate → critique → revise"
  research_synthesis: "round-robin questioning"
  debate: "thesis → antithesis → synthesis"
  interview: "structured queries with follow-ups"
  collaborative_creation: "draft → feedback → revision cycles"

integration:
  memory: "export transcript → 10_exported/ → pipeline → tag participants"
  task_system: "actionable work → task file"
  todo_system: "future ideas → todos/pending/"

status:
  direct_driving:
    AppleScript_ChatGPT: working
    AppleScript_Gemini: working
    Puppeteer: partial
    Browser_MCP: experimental
  orchestrated: {framework: conceptual, coordinator: not_started, approval_ui: not_started}

todos: [implement chat_orchestrator.py, define session schema, response detection heuristics, transcript export format, test 3+ AI parties]
