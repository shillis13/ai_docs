  source: instr_federated_memory_v1.0.md
  version: "1.0"
  condensed_by: librarian

core_principle: "Write observations immediately. Curate later."

philosophy:
  not_checkpoints: write as insight occurs, don't wait for session end
  append_only: add entries, don't rewrite files
  self_defined: manifest defines slot purposes, evolve as needed

locations:
  claude_desktop:
    manifest: ai_claude/memories/manifest.yml
    slots: ai_claude/memories/mem_slots/03.yml-30.yml
  cli_agents:
    pattern: ai_claude/memories/cli/{agent}/manifest.yml
    agents: [librarian, dev-lead, custodian, ops]
    slots: mem_slots/01.yml-10.yml
  codex:
    manifest: ai_codex/memories/manifest.yml
    slots: ai_codex/memories/mem_slots/01.yml-10.yml

entry_format:
  required: [ts, type, content]
  optional: [context, reads]
  types: [learning, observation, pattern, shortcut, issue]
  example: "- ts: 2025-12-11T07:15:23Z\n  type: pattern\n  content: \"insight here\""

what_to_log:
  - patterns discovered
  - shortcuts learned
  - mistakes to avoid
  - user preferences
  - cross-references
  - process improvements
  - questions for later

cross_reference:
  allowed: read any AI's manifest/slots
  protocol: check manifest first, read relevant slots, never write to others
  ecosystem_manifest: ai_general/memories/ai_ecosystem_manifest.yml

read_tracking:
  field: reads (integer)
  purpose: curation hints (high=keep, zero=archive candidate)
  optional: true

session_persistence:
  cli: named sessions with claude_cli.sh -n
  desktop: each chat is a session, write to slots for future chats
