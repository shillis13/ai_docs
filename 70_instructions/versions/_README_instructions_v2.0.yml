  title: AI Instruction Index
  version: 2.0.0
  last_updated: 2025-11-03
  maintainer: PianoMan
  status: active
  source_file: _instr_index_v1.2.md
  migration_notes: Converted from Markdown to YAML as part of req_1019

purpose:
  |
  - Provide a single entry point for every standing instruction that applies to our AI assistants.
  - Clarify which guidance is common to all AIs versus Claude- or ChatGPT-specific.
  - Track versions so we can see when something changes and whether downstream docs need updates.
how_to_use:
  |
  - Start here at the beginning of each new engagement.
  - Load every document in the **Common** section unless a project scope explicitly supersedes it.
  - Layer on the **Claude** or **ChatGPT** overlays only when you are running that specific assistant.
  - Obey status flags: `active` is required, `auxiliary` is optional context, `legacy` requires confirmation.
