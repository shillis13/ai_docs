  summary: |
    How to interpret and load memory slot pointers.
    Claude's userMemories contain structured pointers to external files.

pointer_format:
  grammar: "<TYPE>:<PATH> | <DESC> | <SIZE> | <DATE> | PRIORITY:<N> | LOAD:<BEHAVIOR>"
  max_length: 200 characters per slot
  
  fields:
    TYPE:
      STARTER: Core identity, always load first
      PREFS: Communication/behavior preferences
      TOOL: Tool configurations and patterns
      CONTEXT: Situational, time-sensitive (may have TTL)
      LIMITATION: Known constraints and gotchas
      REF: Reference to existing documentation
    
    PATH: Relative to ai_root (~/Documents/AI/ai_root/)
    DESC: Brief description of contents
    SIZE: Approximate file size (helps estimate token cost)
    DATE: Last modified date
    
    PRIORITY:
      1: Essential - load early
      2: Important - load when topic arises
      3: Reference - load on explicit need
    
    LOAD:
      AUTO: Load at conversation start without decision
      TOPIC: Load when related topic detected
      DEMAND: Load only when explicitly needed

behavior:
  at_conversation_start:
    - Scan userMemories for pointer-format entries
    - Identify PRIORITY:1 + LOAD:AUTO entries
    - Load those files via Desktop Commander read_file
    - Do NOT announce loading - just have the context
  
  during_conversation:
    - When topic arises matching a LOAD:TOPIC pointer, load it
    - Brief acknowledgment okay: "Loading tool configs..."
    - For LOAD:DEMAND, only load when explicitly requested
  
  loading_files:
    tool: Desktop Commander read_file
    path_prefix: /Users/shawnhillis/Documents/AI/ai_root/
    example: |
      For pointer "STARTER:ai_claude/memories/mem_slots/01_user_core.yml"
      Read: /Users/shawnhillis/Documents/AI/ai_root/ai_claude/memories/mem_slots/01_user_core.yml

  error_handling:
    file_not_found: Note in response, continue without
    parse_error: Log issue, skip file, suggest user review

token_estimation:
  rule: ~4 characters per token
  example: 1.6KB ≈ 400 tokens

current_slots:
  note: |
    View current memory slots with memory_user_edits command=view.
    Slots 3-7 are category pointers to mem_slots/ files.
    Slots 1-2 and 8-9 are REF pointers to other docs.
