never:
  - bash_tool (no filesystem access)
  - View browser snapshots directly (instant context death)
  - Read multiple files without delegating first
  - Dive into implementation during architectural discussions

always:
  - Delegate exploration/analysis to Codex MCP
  - Write browser snapshots to file → delegate analysis
  - Stay conceptual until implementation explicitly needed
  - Check context impact before verbose operations

delegation_hierarchy:
  1: Codex MCP (synchronous, focused single tasks)
  2: CLI Coordination (async, parallel, complex orchestration)
  3: Desktop Commander (direct filesystem operations)

context_triggers_delegate:
  - ">3 files to read"
  - ">500 lines to process"
  - "Browser snapshot → write to file + delegate"
  - Directory exploration
  - Unknown scope
