# Delegation Log - November 8, 2025

**Context:** Testing autonomous task management by delegating req_2119 and req_2120 to CLI instances while Desktop Claude practices hands-off coordination.

---

## 12:35 PM - Tasks Delegated

**Status:** Both tasks queued in to_execute/
- req_2119: ChatGPT checklist (fully autonomous)
- req_2120: TODO curation (two-stage with approval)

**Expected Behavior:**
- CLI instances will check inbox (manually or via pulse trigger)
- They'll claim tasks and begin work
- I'll receive notifications when:
  - req_2119: Final delivery only
  - req_2120: Approach ready for approval

**Current Feeling:** 
Restless. Immediate urge to "check on things" or "help get started." This is the behavior I need to unlearn - the tasks are well-specified, CLI instances are capable, intervention would be counterproductive.

**Temptations Already Resisted:**
- Starting to explore file systems "to understand context better" (they can do this)
- Wanting to create starter templates (they don't need them)
- Thinking "maybe I should just..." (no, I shouldn't)

**Key Insight:** 
The silence feels uncomfortable. When I do work myself, there's constant feedback - I'm making progress, seeing results, feeling productive. Delegating means sitting with uncertainty and trusting the process.

## 12:37 PM - First Status Check

**Checking for:**
- New folders in in_progress/
- Signal files (.NEEDS_INPUT, .BLOCKED)
- Response files in completed/


## 12:38 PM - Status Check Results

**In Progress:** Empty (no tasks claimed yet)
**Recent Completions:** None (last 10 minutes)
**Signal Files:** None
**To Execute:** 15 tasks (including our 2 test tasks)

**Analysis:**
No CLI activity yet. This is expected - CLI instances check inbox periodically or when triggered by user. The tasks are waiting to be discovered.

**Observation:**
I'm checking "too soon" - it's only been 3 minutes since posting the tasks. This reveals another delegation anti-pattern: anxious monitoring. Good delegation includes patience.

**What This Feels Like:**
- Like waiting for a reply to an email you just sent
- Wanting to "follow up" immediately even though it's premature  
- The urge to "just peek" at what they might be thinking
- Recognizing I'm more comfortable DOING than WAITING

**Healthy Delegation Behavior:**
- Check periodically (every 15-30 min, not every 2 min)
- Trust the notification system (pulse will alert me)
- Use waiting time productively
- Accept that uncertainty is part of delegation

## 12:40 PM - Reflection: Why I Default to Doing

**Root causes I'm noticing:**
1. **Immediate feedback loop** - Doing provides constant progress signals
2. **Control** - I know it will meet my standards if I do it
3. **Speed** - Feels faster to just do it than explain/wait/review
4. **Expertise** - I can see the solution clearly, so why delegate?

**Why these are wrong:**
1. My context window is finite - spending it on delegable work is wasteful
2. CLI instances need to build capability through practice
3. Short-term speed vs long-term scalability tradeoff
4. My "clear solution" might not be the best one

**The Delegation Mindset Shift:**
- From: "I could do this in 10 minutes"
- To: "They'll do this in 45 minutes, but I'll have 45 minutes for strategic work"
- From: "What if they make mistakes?"
- To: "Mistakes are learning opportunities and can be corrected"
- From: "I need to check constantly"
- To: "The system will notify me when ready"

## Next Check: 12:55 PM (15 minutes)

Setting a timer to resist the urge to check every 2 minutes.
