overview:
  summary: Control Claude CLI and Codex CLI sessions programmatically
  features:
    - Non-blocking operation
    - Persistent context
    - Full screen monitoring
    - Reliable TUI submission

session_names_vs_pids:
  concept: This system uses SESSION NAMES, NOT process IDs (PIDs)
  why_session_names:
    - iTerm2 tabs identified by names not PIDs
    - AppleScript finds tabs by name matching
    - Session survives even if underlying process changes
    - More stable than PID-based tracking

requirements:
  os: macOS (System Events is macOS-specific)
  terminal: iTerm2 (scripts use iTerm2 AppleScript API)
  claude_cli: /usr/local/bin/claude
  codex_cli: accessible as codex command
