# Drafts Directory

Holding pen for artifacts produced by tasks that need review before being filed to their permanent location.

## Workflow

1. **Task produces artifact** → Save to `drafts/` (or note artifact location in task completion)
2. **Periodic review** → Check drafts during weekly pulse
3. **Disposition** → Move to permanent home (`knowledge/`, `specs_and_protocols/`, etc.) or delete

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Is this still relevant?
- [ ] Where does it belong permanently?
- [ ] Does it need updates before filing?
- [ ] Are there related docs to consolidate?
