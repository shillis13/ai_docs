summary: Single-orchestrator spawns search/extract workers, synthesizes internally. No external monitoring.

pattern: single-orchestrator-multiple-workers

flow: |
  Requester → Orchestrator → spawn Search Worker → candidates.yml
                          → spawn Extract Worker → evidence.yml
                          → evaluate (loop if gaps)
                          → synthesize → deliver

when_to_use:
  - Query would exhaust single instance context
  - Search across >10 files
  - Evidence gathering before synthesis
  - Historical analysis across archives

prerequisites:
  mcps: [cli-agent, knowledge-search, messages, Desktop Commander]
  task_dir: /ai_comms/research_tasks/{task_id}/
  files: [query.yml, candidates.yml, evidence.yml, synthesis.yml]

steps:
  1: task-coord:gen_task with template research_orchestrator
  2: Orchestrator runs internally (spawn workers, evaluate, synthesize)
  3: messages:list_direct to receive results

worker_design:
  - Lightweight, single-purpose
  - Write to shared task dir
  - Signal via messages MCP
  - Self-terminate after phase
  - Stateless (files hold state)

common_issues:
  worker_exhaustion: Limit candidates to 15-20
  orchestrator_fills: Pre-categorize evidence
  infinite_loop: Hard limit 3 iterations
