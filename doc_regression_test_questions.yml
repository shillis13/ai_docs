  purpose: Verify new AI instances can discover and apply knowledge from docs
  generated: "2025-12-08"
  updated: "2025-12-11"
  instructions: |
    Present these questions to a fresh Claude instance with access to the ai_root
    workspace via Desktop Commander. The AI should discover relevant documentation
    using memory pointers, the knowledge manifest, and search capabilities.
    
    Do NOT provide source file hints. The test validates documentation discoverability.
    
    Grade responses using doc_regression_test_ANSWERS.yml (kept separate).
