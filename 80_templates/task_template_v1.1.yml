            1. Run validate.sh on each file

        - type: paragraph
          text: This assumes the author knows the best path. The worker executes steps
            without understanding why. If something unexpected happens, they have
            no basis for judgment.

            Goal: All conversations validated, chunked, and organized for retrieval.

            Requirements:
            - Chunks must not exceed 4000 tokens
            - Invalid files quarantined with documented reason

            Considerations:
            - Chunker should break on assistant messages, not user messages
            - Watch for escaped unicode - indicates upstream parsing failure
        - type: paragraph
          text: This trusts the worker's intelligence. They understand the outcome
            needed and the constraints. They can adapt when reality doesn't match
            expectations. They can catch problems the author didn't anticipate.

        heading: Why This Matters
        blocks:
        - type: paragraph
          text: An intelligent agent with good context will often find better solutions
            than rigid procedures allow. More importantly, they can **notice when
            something is wrong** - but only if they understand what "right" looks
            like.
        - type: paragraph
          text: A worker following steps will execute them perfectly and produce garbage
            if the steps are flawed. A worker pursuing a goal with understanding will
            stop and say "this output doesn't look right."

        blocks:
        - type: paragraph
          text: |-
            1. **Goal describes WHAT, not HOW** - The outcome, not the steps to get there
            2. **Requirements are hard constraints** - Non-negotiable. Must be true for success.
            3. **Considerations are soft guidance** - Context for judgment. "Prefer X" not "Always X"
            4. **Examples show good AND bad** - Workers need to recognize failure, not just success
            5. **Trust intelligence, provide context** - Don't script; inform and empower

            Do Instead: Use Considerations for preferences
          - Don't: Assume worker knows what "good" looks like
            Do Instead: Provide examples of success and failure
          - Don't: Write procedures disguised as goals
            Do Instead: 'Ask: "Could a smart person achieve this differently?"'
